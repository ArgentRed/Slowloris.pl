Slowloris.pl guide (rewritten by ArgentRed)



This guide is written with the intention that the user is using a Windows OS and is launching 
a slowloris attack. Since the combined size of slowloris.pl & Perl (at the time of typing this) 
is less than 1GB you can utilize cheap flashdrives to turn public computers into launchpads for 
slowloris dos attacks. Or, you can use this guide more traditionally and launch a slowloris 
attack from your own personal computer.
